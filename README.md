Wow, Jumbo was... just, wow. Theater was buzzing. Just been, you know, in there. Like I walked into another world and it spat me right out again. Popcorn all everywhere, the floor a crunchy minefield. Back's gotta be a twisted wire now, that seat like a medieval torture device... but worth it? Yeah, I guess.

The screen was blazing like a live wire, so many colors, my eyes are still flashing like I just blew a fuse. The noise, like standing under a transformer. Man, everywhere action, like a pack of ferrets in a junk shop. I remember that one scene, the lights were twinkling, flickering just like a short circuit going haywire in an old house. And I'm thinking, is this gonna blow up? Both in my face and on screen!

> Main character, such a peculiar one, right? The way she, the way she danced with the ferris wheel, like she was grounding it, like an electrician hugging a breaker after the storm. Yeah, that, so surreal. The machines come alive... her world spinning... literally spinning, right? Someone mentioned to download the movie. And I thought, nope, you gotta watch the movie in the theater, for the full shock, raw spark zapping through the brain.

The crowd, a buzzing nest, couldn't tell if it was life's applause or an electric hum... or maybe it was both. I licked my fingers, tasted like scorched popcorn, no butter, just current.

There's a little part of my brain going... how's that ferris wheel set up? Bolted to the ground like a stubborn plug or just ready to lift off into the night sky, shooting sparks? Someone should check that wiring.

Anyway, reminds me. Gotta call Marty about those light fixtures in the garage. They flicker just like that one scene where he, or she, not quite sure now... anyway, needa download the movie for when I'm elbow-deep in wires this weekend.
